                    A <term>cipher</term><idx>cipher</idx> is a system by which a letter or block of letters in a message is replaced by another letter or block of letters in a systematic way.  In this chapter we will focus on <term>monoalphabetic substitution ciphers</term>
                    <idx>monoalphabetic substitution cipher</idx> in which the substitution is always carried out in the same way with one-to-one correspondence between letters.

            One of the earliest types of cipher (sometimes spelled <em>cypher</em> in older documents) that we have a record of was the Caesar shift cipher used by Julius Caesar around 100 BCE. Here it is as described by Suetonius who lived about 150 to 200 years after Julius Caesar.

        <p>
            Augustus Caesar a short time later also employed a shift cipher, though arguably a much less effective one:

                    Here is a longer message for you to practice on.  The shift for this message was by a factor of seven, so the a goes to the h.  This doesn't really offer much more security, especially since there are only twenty six possible shift ciphers and one of those doesn't change anything.  While you were deciphering this what patterns did you notice? What words stood out?  How could we make this a more secure (harder to crack) cipher?  These are all questions that we will investigate in more detail throughout the text.

            Were you able to <term>decrypt</term><idx>decrypt</idx> the message?  Throughout this text we will present material through increasingly more difficult ciphers and codes.  Now, take some time to try and hone your skills on the next few passages that demonstrate ways in which ciphers may be made more secure.  As you go through each be sure to consider the following questions:

            <ul>
                <li> How does the new method compare to those which we have previously considered, what does it do to make the message more secure?</li>
                <li> Each time we change the method in which messages are enciphered what doesn't change?  </li>
                <li> Are there any properties that can not change?  That is, are there rules about how English is put together that we can make use of?</li>
                <li> If you have suspicions about what a message, or part of a message, might say how can you use this to help you?</li>
                <li> What sort of data might we keep track of or how can we organize our thoughts to help us solve these puzzles?</li>

            We can make a message harder to decipher simply by using a more inventive method of encipherment than just a shift.  The last exercise in this section was enciphered with a slightly trickier cipher than the previous ciphers so I put the spaces and punctuation back in. Also, while it is a harder cipher it is not completely random, there is a pattern to how the key was generated; so in the table below the message try filling in the cipher alphabet below the plain alphabet as you work, and see if you can spot a pattern.

                        <li>The word <c>QAA</c> appears twice on its own and once as the end of another word, what three letter plaintext words might look like this?</li>
                        <li>After you have spent some time looking at the message and trying to identify some of the ciphertext start to fill in the copy of substitution table and see if you notice any patterns.</li>

                    <q>Before you begin a thing, remind yourself that difficulties and delays quite impossible to foresee are ahead. If you could see them clearly, naturally you could do a great deal to get rid of them but you can't. You can only see one thing clearly and that is your goal. Form a mental vision of that and cling to it through thick and thin.'' - Kathleen Norris</q>

        This particular passage was enciphered using what is called a keyword cipher, keyword=ZEBRA, key letter=a.  Try lining up the plain text and cipher text alphabets to see how this works. -->
