        <introduction>
            <p>
                For each exercise where you need to encipher or decipher a message do enough work to demonstrate that
                you clearly understand how to do the job; say at encipher or decipher least 10 characters or write down the plain text
                alphabet and corresponding cipher text alphabet.

                    atabash you replace <em>a</em> with <em>Z</em>, <em>b</em> with <em>Y</em>, <em>c</em> with <em>X</em>,
                    and so on.  Fill in the table below with the appropriate cipher alphabet for atabash. Now, try to use your table to encipher the following message with atabash.
