            <introduction>
                <p>
                    The cipher we will focus on here, Hill's Cipher, is an early example of a cipher based purely in the mathematics of 
                    number theory and algebra; the areas of mathematics which now dominate all of modern 
                    cryptography.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Number theory has a long and rich history with many fundamental results dating all the way back to Euclid's Elements in 300 BCE, and with results found across the globe in different cultures.  Number theory as we understand and use it today is due in large part to Carl Friedrich Gauss and his text 
                    <em>Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</em> published in 1801 (when Gauss was 24).  Algebra (or more properly linear and abstract algebra) as it is going to be used here is much younger tracing its roots back only a couple hundred years to the early nineteenth century and the work of Cauchy and Galois.

                    As with previous topics we will begin by looking at an original source text when possible and trying to understand what it is saying.  However, given the importance of this material to the rest of what we will be discussing in subsequent chapters, we will look at the material from a more modern perspective.

                            Hill starts by describing how we will add and multiply with the alphabet, looking at his 
                            description why in his illustration does <m>j+w</m> which should be <m>25+14=39</m> 
                            (see <xref ref="hill_alpha_numeric_corespondence">Hill's Correspondence</xref>) come 
                            out to be <m>m</m> which is 13?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In his illustration he also says <m>hm</m> which should be 4 times 13, or 52, is 
                            <m>k</m> which is 0, why is this the case?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Along the same lines, why does <m>f+y</m> equal <m>k</m> and why does <m>an</m> (<m>a</m> times <m>n</m>) 
                            equal <m>z</m>?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Thinking about your previous answers, what are the values of the following: <m>j+z</m>, 
                            <m>nf</m>, <m>au+j</m>, and <m>bv+jw</m>.

                    In this section of text Hill has introduced us to the idea of modular arithmetic and modular equivalence, in 
                    particular the idea of equivalence modulo 26.  This is a concept which will be central to most 
                    everything else we do so we need to spend a little more time trying to precisely understand modular 
                    equivalence.

                        Suppose that <m>n=14</m>, then <me>36\equiv 8\pmod{n}</me> because <me>36=2\cdot 14 + 8\ \text{and}\ 
                        8=0\cdot (14) + 8</me> so we get the same remainder when we divide by <m>n=14</m>.  Alternately,
                        we can observe that <m>36-8=28</m> and <m>28=2\cdot(14)</m> is divisible by <m>n=14</m>.

                        Using the same value for <m>n</m> we say that <m>3\cdot 5\equiv 1\pmod{n}</m> because 
                        <me>3\cdot 5=15=1\cdot (14) +1,</me> that is the remainder when <m>3\cdot 5</m> is divided by <m>n</m> is 1.

                            Write down another multiplication and addition table as  you did in 
                            above of arithmetic modulo 14, but with a modulus of 
                            <m>n=7</m>, so when you multiply and add you will always divide 
                            by 7 afterwards and write down the remainder.  After you write down 
                            the tables write down the pairs of multiplicative and additive inverses.

                    Comprehension Check: Look back at what Hill had to say and at the examples you have worked through 
                    when you used moduli of <m>n=14,10,12</m> or <m>7</m> as you think about the following questions.

                            We say that two integers are <em>relatively prime</em> if the largest positive 
                            integers which divided them both, their <em>greatest common divisor</em>, is 1.  
                            For example the greatest common divisor of 7 and 36 is 1 so they are relatively prime, 
                            however the greatest common divisor of 30 and 36 is 6 so they are not relatively prime.
