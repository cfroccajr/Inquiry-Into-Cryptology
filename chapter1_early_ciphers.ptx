                    A <term>cipher</term><idx>cipher</idx> is a system by which a letter or block of letters in a message is replaced by another letter or block of letters in a systematic way.  In this chapter we will focus on <term>monoalphabetic substitution ciphers</term>
                    <idx>monoalphabetic substitution cipher</idx> in which the substitution is always carried out in the same way with one-to-one correspondence between letters.

        <p>
            One of the earliest types of cipher (sometimes spelled <em>cypher</em> in older documents) that we have a record of was the Caesar shift cipher used by Julius Caesar around 100 BCE. Here it is as described by Suetonius who lived about 150 to 200 years after Julius Caesar.

                <p>
                    <q>There are extant likewise some letters from him to Cicero and others to his friends concerning his domestic affairs in which if there was occasion for secrecy he wrote in cyphers, that is he used the alphabet in such a manner that not a single ward could be made out. The way to decipher those epistles was to substitute the fourth for the first letter as d for a and so for the other letters respectively.</q>

            Augustus Caesar a short time later also employed a shift cipher, though arguably a much less effective one:

                    Here is a longer message for you to practice on.  The shift for this message was by a factor of seven, so the a goes to the h.  This doesn't really offer much more security, especially since there are only twenty six possible shift ciphers and one of those doesn't change anything.  While you were deciphering this what patterns did you notice? What words stood out?  How could we make this a more secure (harder to crack) cipher?  These are all questions that we will investigate in more detail throughout the text.

            Were you able to <term>decrypt</term><idx>decrypt</idx> the message?  Throughout this text we will present material through increasingly more difficult ciphers and codes.  Now, take some time to try and hone your skills on the next few passages that demonstrate ways in which ciphers may be made more secure.  As you go through each be sure to consider the following questions:

            <ul>
                <li> How does the new method compare to those which we have previously considered, what does it do to make the message more secure?</li>
                <li> Each time we change the method in which messages are enciphered what doesn't change?  </li>
                <li> Are there any properties that can not change?  That is, are there rules about how English is put together that we can make use of?</li>
                <li> If you have suspicions about what a message, or part of a message, might say how can you use this to help you?</li>
                <li> What sort of data might we keep track of or how can we organize our thoughts to help us solve these puzzles?</li>

            Each of the previous messages used a simple shift cipher of which, in English, there are only twenty five (twenty six if you allow a shift of 0).  However if we look at all the possible ways that we can rearrange twenty six letters we really have a lot more options.

Therefore in a thousand million of years he could write <me>585,600,000,000,000,</me> which being multiplied by 1,000,000,000, the number of writers supposed, the product will be <me>585,600,000,000,000,000,000,000,</me> which wants of the number of combinations no less than <me>348,484,017,332,394,393,600,000.</me>

            We can make a message harder to decipher simply by using a more inventive method of encipherment than just a shift.  The last exercise in this section was enciphered with a slightly trickier cipher than the previous ciphers so I put the spaces and punctuation back in. Also, while it is a harder cipher it is not completely random, there is a pattern to how the key was generated; so in the table below the message try filling in the cipher alphabet below the plain alphabet as you work, and see if you can spot a pattern.

        <title>Arabic Numerical Ciphers</title>
        <p>
            Mathematics played no role in the ciphers we examined in the previous section.  In fact math played no role in cryptology at all until <term>Arabic scholars</term><idx>Arabic scholar</idx><fn xml:id="arabic_scholars">When math historians, or historians in general, speak of Arabic scholars it is a reference to the language and not the ethnicity or location of the scholars.</fn> performed basic data analysis on the Arabic language in the 9th century CE.  They quickly realized that their observations could be used to break the basic ciphers we have been considering.  However, that is a topic for the next chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this section we will introduce some other work done by Arabic scholars. <xref ref="cr_crypt_arabic" detail="vol. 3" />  We are going to look at some methods of enciphering text by first changing the text to numbers, some of these methods today would be called <term>affine ciphers</term><idx>affine cipher</idx>.
        </p>
        <p>
            They began by associating each letter of the alphabet with a number in a manner similar to the following:
        </p>
            <xi:include href="table_code/arabic_alpha_table.ptx"/>
        <p>
            Once this is done there are then a variety of ways in which we may encipher our message. Carefully read through these passages from <em>ibn ad-Durayhim's</em><idx>ibn ad-Durayhim</idx> treatise written in the <m>12^{th}</m> century CE; try to get an idea of how his encipherments worked before going on.

                        <li>
                            By substituting decimal numerical alphabet for letters in four different ways:
                            by writing the numbers in words as pronounced; or by finger-bending, using the fingers to communicate the message visually to a recipient; or by writing the numbers as numerals such as writing <em>(mhmd: forty, eight, forty, four)</em>; or by giving the cryptogram a semblance of a page of a financial register.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            By recovering the cryptogram numeral into a number of letters - a method of encipherment which involves more sophistication. There are many combinations that can be used in this method; for example in <em>(mhmd: jl, fb, jl, ca)</em> or <em>(kk, ga, kk, bb)</em> . One can even form delusive words such as <em>(mhmd: lead, cad, deal, baa)</em>, or substitute two words for a letter,
                            e.g. <em>(ali: <m>\overline{dig\ fad}</m>, <m>\overline{cab\ ab}</m>)</em>,
                            in which case a line is to be drawn over two words to denote that they represent one letter.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            By multiplying the number representing the letter by two, and so write <em>(mhmd: q, jf, q, h)</em> and <em>(ali: ob, jh)</em>, etc; or multiply it by three, thus writing <em>(mhmd: sk, kd, sk, jb)</em> and <em>(ali: rc, kg)</em>. Numbers can also be multiplied by four or five."
                            <fn xml:id="arabic_fn">
                                The examples here are very loosely based on the Arabic examples in the translation. The "mhmd" is Mohamed since Arabic is written without vowels, and for "ali" the a and l together are treated as a single letter.

                    For all of these the first step is to use <xref ref="table_numeric_alpha"/> to translate the letters to numbers.  Then you will need to in some way manipulate those numbers and/or translate them back to words and letters using the table.  How specifically this happens depends on the cipher method.

                    Another type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher is called a <term>keyword cipher</term>.
                    <idx>keyword cipher</idx>The key for this cipher consists of two pieces, a
                    <em>key word</em> and a <em>key letter</em>.  You write the key word in the cipher alphabet starting
                    underneath the key letter and then write the remaining letters of the alphabet in order after that.  So, if
                    the key word is <em>ZEBRA</em> with key letter <em>f</em> we start as follows:
