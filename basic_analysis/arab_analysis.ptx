                    <term>Cryptanalysis</term><idx>cryptanalysis</idx> is the process by which we try to determine the meaning of a message without the aid of a key.  We will sometimes describe this as <term>decrypting</term><idx>decrypting</idx> a message as opposed to <term>deciphering</term><idx>deciphering</idx> a message which is what we do when we know the key.

            The first place math was employed in the science of cryptology was in the analysis of languages.  The following is from <em>al-Kindi's</em><idx>al-Kindi</idx> treatise on cryptanalysis written around the year 873 CE.  Try to read through it carefully and then consider the questions that follow it.

            What al-Kindi is describing above is what we now call <term>frequency analysis</term> which is the first step in

                    cryptanalysis, the process of breaking an unknown cipher or code.

                        <q>In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the
                        University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course
                        prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,
                        I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant
                        Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before
                        I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at
                        Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and
                        was already deep in the enemyâ€™s country. I followed, however, with many
                        other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded
                        in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once
                        entered upon my new duties.</q> - <em>A Study in Scarlet</em>, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle <xref ref="cr_doyle_sis" />

Hopefully when you analyze this you will see that even when this is enciphered the letter frequencies stay the same, as long as the cipher is monoalphabetic.  In particular for a shift cipher the letter frequencies even maintain the same relative position to each other, just slid along like the letters; this makes such a cipher very easy to spot and crack. -->
