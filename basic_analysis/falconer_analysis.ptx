        <title> Falconer's Approach</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>
                In 1685 John Falconer<idx>Falconer, John</idx>, who we met briefly in <xref ref="section_ancient_ciphers"/>, wrote the second ever published text in English on the subject of cryptology; it has the rather lengthy title <em>Cryptomenysis patefacta; or, the art of secret information disclosed without a key. containing plain and demonstrative rule, for decyphering</em>.  Beyond this work little is known about him for certain. A descendant of his writing in the nineteenth century claimed that John was the personal cipher keeper for King James II and followed the king into exile in France where he died.  In slim support of this the book is dedicated to King James II and addressed to the king's secretary of state.  However, no readily available documented evidence exists to independently corroborate his descendant's claims, and in fact there are some tax records for John and his wife, Mary Dalmahoy, in Edinburgh Scotland, from 1695, over six years after James fled to France. <xref ref="cr_crypt_rocca_falconer"/>
            </p>
            <p>
                In his text John Falconer presents a wide variety of ciphers and, for most of them suggestions, for how we might attack them.  In this section we will focus on his directions for how to break, or attempt to break, what we now call monoalphabetic substitution ciphers.

                    <li>In what ways does Falconer say that one, two, and three letter words can help us?</li>
                    <li>According to Falconer when might we expect a double letter to be a vowel and when might it be a consonant?</li>
                    <li>Try to find out why Falconer says <em><q>Jilt</q></em> and <em><q>Vulture</q></em> begin with

                For the following <em>Checkpoints</em> find a large sample of normal English text (you can use the one you found for the chekpoints in <xref ref="section_arab_analysis" />, but something bigger may be better).  You will also want to use the n-gram counting and word counting tools below.

                        Falconer's first three pieces of advice are similar to what we have looked at before;
                        his fourth comment is something a little new.  Using the same text which you analyzed before
                        set the <em>n-gram counter</em> to count two letter combinations in your text (<m>N=2</m>). Once you have
                        the count take note of which combinations of letters appear most often and for each vowel which two or
                        three consonants it is most often paired with.

                        and suffixes (what Falconer called <em>propositions and terminations</em>) within the text.
