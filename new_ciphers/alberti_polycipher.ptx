                        A <term>polyalphabetic substitution cipher</term><idx>polyalphabetic substitution cipher</idx> is a cipher in which a single plaintext letter maybe replaced by several different ciphertext letters, groups of letters, or symbols and every letter, group of letters, or symbol in the ciphertext may represent more than one plain text letter.

            <p>
                One of Leon Battista Alberti's greatest contributions to cryptology was not his cryptanalysis skills but an entirely new kind of cipher.  Many efforts had been and would be made to shore up monoalphabetic substitution ciphers.  Some of these efforts worked well enough but they were never sufficiently different to make them immune to the sorts of attacks we have studied before.   Alberti made something truly different
                he invented a <term>polyalphabetic substitution cipher</term>.  This was a cipher that did not just replace the plain text alphabet with a single separate alphabet but instead used multiple enciphering alphabets to create greater confusion and security.

                <p>
                    The key to Alberti's new system was a device he called a <term><q>formula</q></term>
                    <idx>formula (Alberti)</idx>.  This was a cipher disk consisting of a fixed outer disk and a mobile inner disk.  In his basic description of his new cipher he would use the outer ring of upper case letters for his plain text and the inner mobile ring of lower case letters for his cipher text.

                        If you compare the inner and outer rings of the formula (cipher disk) what difference do you notice?  Why do you think Alberti might have made these choices?  (For reference I made an updated version in the appendix where I made similar choices, <xref ref="appendix_figure_modern" />.)

            <p>
                In spite of the fact that Alberti invented the polyalphabetic cipher his is not the name associated with it, instead that honor goes to the Frenchmen <em><alert>Blaise de Vigen&#x00E8;re</alert></em><idx>Vigen&#x00E8;re, Blaise de</idx>.  Vigen&#x00E8;re made a careful study of the cryptographers who had come before him and in 1586 he published the culmination of his work in his <em>Traict&#x00E9; des chiffress, ou secr&#x00E8;tes mani&#x00E8;res d'escrire</em><xref ref="cr_crypt_vigenere" />.  In the Traict&#x00E9; he described a wide variety of older ciphers and his improvements to them.  Among these was his take on Alberti's polyalphabetic cipher.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the key advances that Vigen&#x00E8;re made was to replace the disk with a table [<xref ref="figure_vigenere_table" text="type-global"/>, <xref ref="cr_crypt_vigenere" detail="p. 50b (102)"/><fn>In the page designation <q>p. 50b (102)</q> the 102 is the page in the pdf document while the 50b is the page in the manuscript.</fn>].  This made it easier to vary between alphabets without having to move inner and outer disks to different positions.

                Today when we use the Vigen&#x00E8;re Cipher we use a table <xref ref="appendix_figure_vigenere_new" text="type-global" /> which is simpler, and makes the resulting cipher a little easier to crack.  The video below explains using the more modern table and you will play with the modern version in the exercises.
