            <p>
                Below is a description of Vigen&#x00E8;re's more secure variation on an autokey cipher.
                <fn>
                    This translation is mostly from Charles Mendelsohn in <xref ref="cr_crypt_mendelsohn_vigenere" detail="p. 128"/>, I have supplemented with material from the original description by Vigen&#x00E8;re is in <xref ref="cr_crypt_vigenere" detail="pp.49-49b"/>.
                </fn>
                Read carefully through the passage above, you will need to use <xref ref="vigenere_auto_table" text="type-global" /> in order to follow along.

                <alert>Comprehension Check:</alert> It will be easier to follow what is happening in this passage if we write out the message as follows:
            </p>
            <p>Text for the first cipher method:</p>
            <pre>
                    Plaintext:    a u n o m d e l e t e r n e l
                    Key Letter:   D A U N O M D E L E T E R N E
                    Ciphertext: D X I A H G U P T M L S H I X T
            </pre>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Vigen&#x00E8;re uses a <em>D</em> as the key to encipher the first letter, in the first method described where does he get the subsequent letters for the key?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The letter <em>D</em> enciphers <em>a</em> as <em>X</em>, but the <em>a</em> is not in row <em>D</em> of <xref ref="vigenere_auto_table"/> so how do we know that the <em>a</em> should be <em>X</em> ?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At one point Vigen&#x00E8;re uses a key letter of <em>U</em> but there is no row <em>U</em> on his table, looking at how the <em>U</em> enciphers the <em>n</em>, what row is he using in place of <em>U</em>?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <em>a</em> was enciphered as <em>X</em>, but the first letter of the ciphertext is <em>D</em>, also the ciphertext is one character longer than the plaintext, what is the explanation for both of these?  Where did the leading <em>D</em> come from?
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Text for the second cipher method:</p>
            <pre>
                    Plaintext:    a u n o m d e l e t e r n e l
                    Key Letter:   D X H E E C O U ...
                    Ciphertext: D X H E E C O U M ...
            </pre>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In the second method described he again starts with a key of <em>D</em> but then where does he get the the next key letter <em>X</em>? What about the key letter <em>H</em>? Try to complete the cipher using the second method.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Vigen&#x00E8;re believes his second method is more secure, looking at the <em>key</em> for the second method why do you think he believes this?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you compare the <em>key</em> for his second method to the cipher text he generates why is Vigen&#x00E8;re wrong about his second method being more secure?
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <em><alert>Reflection:</alert></em> If you go back and look carefully at the preceding couple of exercises you will notice that deciphering a message enciphered using the first autokey method is equivalent to second method and vice versa.  In what way does this weaken the cipher?
