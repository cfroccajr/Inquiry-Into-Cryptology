            <p>
                Among Thomas Jefferson's papers in the library of congress there are atleast 63 distinct items which discuss ciphers.  In one of these, a letter from Jefferson to Meriwether Lewis (<url href="http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/mtj.mtjbib012330">Thomas Jefferson to Meriwether Lewis, April 20, 1803</url>), Jefferson suggests that they use Vigen&#x00E8;re's cipher for their correspondence.

                    <p>
                        Next, using the key letter to tell you the column and the plaintext to tell you the row, look up the cipher letters inside the table:

                        As before write out the message with the key lined up above it.  Then you can look up the key letter along the top of Jefferson's table and the message letters or numbers along the sides.

                Here is a brief description of Thomas Jefferson's
                <url href="https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/wheel-cipher">
                wheel cipher</url>, and here is his description <url href="http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/mtj.mtjbib025756"> Jefferson's Wheel Cipher,</url> that we examine below.

                <ul>
                    <li>If the cylinder we start with is 8 inches long, how many discs do we get following Jefferson's directions?</li>
                    <li>Using factorials (see <xref ref="definition_factorial"/>), in how many ways could you rearrange the number of discs you found in the previous problem?</li>
                    <li>In his description Jefferson says that we should write the alphabet around the edge of each disk <q>not in their established order, but jumbled &amp; without order so that no two shall be alike</q>, how many ways can we rearrange the letters of the alphabet so that they are not in their usual order?</li>
                    <li>Jefferson was unfortunately wrong when he said <q>As the others will be jumbled &amp; have no meaning he cannot mistake the true one intended.</q>  Why did he believe this was the case, what did he mean by this?  Can you construct a way to arrange letters on a disk so that you could end up with more than one message?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                While his cipher was not used while Jefferson was in office a variation of it was employed from about 1920 to 1945 in the form of the M-94 Cipher Cylinder.

                        Because after lining up the letters you want you can choose to write down any other row, there are multiple different asnwers.  One posibility is: <c>MMIHODVWR9RN</c>
