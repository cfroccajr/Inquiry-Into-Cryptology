        <!-- Basic Concept from Vernam -->
            <subsubsection xml:id="basic_idea">
                <title>Vernam's Plan</title>
                <assemblage>
                    <p> 
                        Let us suppose that the first character of the message to he transmitted is <q>A.</q> The code
                        signal of <q>A</q> is <q>++---,</q> where <q>-</q> represents an <q>open</q> or <q>spacing</q> impulse
                        and <q>+</q> represents a <q>closed</q> or <q>marking</q> impulse in the system here illustrated,
                        although it will be understood that positive and negative current impulses may be used
                        instead of closed and open circuit operation if desired. For ciphering and deciphering
                        the message the ciphering devices at the opposite ends of the line are provided with
                        identical sections of tape upon which are recorded a series of code signals which are
                        preferably selected at random but if desired may themselves represent a predetermined
                        series of letters or words. Let us suppose that the letter <q>B</q> happens to be in the
                        ciphering transmitter at the same moment that the letter <q>A</q> is being sent from the
                        normal transmitter. The code for the letter <q>B</q> is <q>+--++.</q> The sending of <q>A</q>
                        from the normal transmitter means that the contacts 25 and 26 will be closed, while the
                        contacts 27, 28 and 29 are open. Thus, relays 14 and 15 will be energized and close
                        their contacts, while relays 16, 17 and 18 remain unenergized. The presence of the letter
                        <q>B</q> in the code transmitter means that contacts 36, 39 and 40, representing the plus
                        impulses for <q>B,</q> will be in contact with the bus-bar 32, which is connected to [the] battery
                        and that contacts 37 and 38, representing the negative impulses for this character
                        will be in contact with bus-bar 33 which is grounded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a result of this combination of contacts in the two transmitters, it will be seen
                        that the relay 19 is connected at both ends to battery; that relay 20 is connected at one
                        end to battery at 24 and at the other end to ground at 35; that relay 21 is connected at
                        one end to ground through the resistance 31, and at the other end to ground at 35 ; that
                        relay 22 is connected at one end to ground through resistance 31, and at the other end
                        to battery at 34, and that relay 23 is connected to ground through the resistance 31
                        at one end and the battery 34 at the other. Therefore, relays 20, 22 and 23 will close
                        their contacts; and relays 19 and 21 will remain open. Consequently, as the distributer
                        arm 10 rotates over the contacts 1 to 5, impulses will be transmitted to the line :from
                        contacts 2, 4 and 5 and none from contacts 1 and 3. This means that the signal
                        <q>-+-++</q> will be transmitted over the line and this signal represents the letter
                        <q>G</q> and not the letter <q>A</q> which is the character of the message to be transmitted.
