                <p>
                    What follows are excerpts from Friedrich Kasiski's 1863 text on cryptography
                    <em>Die Geheimschriften und die Dechiffrir-Kunst</em>,
                    which was translated into English and privately published
                    by R. W. Pettengill in 1954 as <em>Secret Writings and the Art of Deciphering</em><xref ref="cr_crypt_kasiski"/>.
                    For brevity we will only examine a few of Kasiski's key points and we will use a long English rather than
                    a short German quote in order to make his points.  While these adjustments have been made to aid in understanding,
                    whenever possible we will remain faithful to the original.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this section we will use the following example quote for our analysis.  It is enciphered using a Vigen&#x00E8;re cipher with 
                    the keyword <c>BERLIN</c>.  You may find it useful to redo the enciphering for yourself.

                            In section (75) Kasiski writes about letters of the <em>key</em> 
                            uniting with repetitions of <em>plain text</em>, how does this compare 
                            to Falconer's observations in 
                            <xref ref="section_polyalphabetic_attack1" text="type-global"/>?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We know that the Vigen&#x00E8;re cipher can encipher many different plain text letters 
                            as the same cipher text letter, so why is it reasonable for Kasiski to believe that 
                            all the <c>U</c>'s in column 1 should represent <c>e</c> or that all the 
                            <c>P</c>'s in column 5 might represent <c>t</c>?  (Answer in terms 
                            of how we know the Vigen&#x00E8;re cipher works.)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Break the plain text message in <xref ref="example_kasiski" text="type-global" /> into blocks of six 
                            then use the key <c>BERLIN</c> and the modern Vigen&#x00E8;re table 
                            <xref ref="appendix_figure_vigenere_new" text="type-global" /> 
                            to encipher it, you should get the same cipher text as that 
                            which is in the figure.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Is Kasiski right about his guesses, that is do the <c>U</c> and <c>I</c> in the first and second 
                            columns represent <c>e</c>, or do the <c>E</c> and <c>K</c> in the second and third columns 
                            represent <c>t</c>?  How do your answers to this question relate to Kasiski's comments in 
                            section (72)?

                            Look carefully at the cipher text in <xref ref="example_kasiski" text="type-global" />, 
                            how often do you find the bi-grams <c>UL, XY, KS, EP</c> and <c>BU</c>?  
                            Do they always line up with the cipher key so that they give <c>th</c> when you

                        <li>
                            For this observation Kasiski enciphered <c>th</c> using each of the pairs of letters 
                            <c>BE, ER, RL, LI</c> and <c>IN</c> from <c>BERLIN</c>, but he didn't consider 
                            enciphering it with <c>NB</c> (i.e. wrapping around from column 6 back to 1).  Encipher 
                            the bi-gram <c>th</c> using the rows <c>NB</c> in the Vigen&#x00E8;re table 
                            <xref ref="appendix_figure_vigenere_new" text="type-global" />, what cipher bi-gram do 
                            you get?  How often to you find that bi-gram in the cipher text in 
                            <xref ref="example_kasiski" text="type-global" />? (Remember that you need to look 
                            from columns 6 to 1.)

                    Kasiski's observations above, and Falconer's previously, give us a way to attack Vigenere's cipher if we know the key length.  But first we need to find the key length.

                        <li>
                            Why did Kasiski add two to the number of characters between the
                            two repeated copies of <c>UL</c>?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The three letter cipher <c>ULV</c> also appears more than once,
                            after counting the number of characters from one to the next how many
                            letters should you add to that count before factoring it?  What about for the
                            repeated cipher <c>UIIY</c>?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Go through the entire cipher text in <xref ref="example_kasiski" text="type-global" />,
                            look for all the repeated ciphers which are at least two characters long, then
                            for each one write down the distance between them and the factors of those
                            distances.  What number(s) pop up most often?  Why does this make sense?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally we find the key: In what follows Kasiski makes use of what he calls <em>the key table</em> which is 
                    a rearranged Vigen&#x00E8;re table with plain text letters on the left, cipher letters along the top and the 
                    possible key letters on the interior. So it tells us that if we have a cipher letter <c>J</c> which we 
                    believe represents a plain text letter <em>i</em> then looking in the table we can see the corresponding 
                    key letter was a <c>B</c>.

                                    Since Aramis's singular transformation into a confessor of the order, Baisemeaux was no longer the same man. Up to that period, the place which Aramis had held in the worthy governor's estimation was that of a prelate whom he respected and a friend to whom he owed a debt of gratitude; but now he felt himself an inferior, and that Aramis was his master. He himself lighted a lantern, summoned a turnkey, and said, returning to Aramis, "I am at your orders, monseigneur." Aramis merely nodded his head, as much as to say, "Very good"; and signed to him with his hand to lead the way.

He asked himself why the king had sent for him back; why the Iron Mask had thrown the silver plate at the feet of Raoul. As to the first subject, the reply was negative; he knew right well that the king's calling him was from necessity. He still further knew that Louis XIV. must experience an imperious desire for a private conversation with one whom the possession of such a secret placed on a level with the highest powers of the kingdom. But as to saying exactly what the king's wish was, D'Artagnan found himself completely at a loss. The musketeer had no doubts, either, upon the reason which had urged the unfortunate Philippe to reveal his character and birth. Philippe, buried forever beneath a mask of steel, exiled to a country where the men seemed little more than slaves of the elements; Philippe, deprived even of the society of D'Artagnan, who had loaded him with honors ...
