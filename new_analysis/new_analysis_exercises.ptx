                    many years ago i contracted an intimacy with a mr william legrand he
                    was of an ancient huguenot family and had once been wealthy but a
                    series of misfortunes had reduced him to want to avoid the
                    mortification consequent upon his disasters he left new orleans the
                    city of his forefathers and took up his residence at sullivans island
                    near charleston south carolina this island is a very singular one it
                    consists of little else than the sea sand and is about three miles long
                    its breadth at no point exceeds a quarter of a mile it is separated
                    from the main land by a scarcely perceptible creek oozing its way
                    through a wilderness of reeds and slime a favorite resort of the marsh
                    hen the vegetation as might be supposed is scant or at least dwarfish
                    no trees of any magnitude are to be seen near the western extremity
                    where fort moultrie stands and where are some miserable frame buildings
                    tenanted during summer by the fugitives from charleston dust and fever
                    may be found indeed the bristly palmetto but the whole island with the
                    exception of this western point and a line of hard white beach on the
                    seacoast is covered with a dense undergrowth of the sweet myrtle so much
                    prized by the horticulturists of england the shrub here often attains
                    the height of fifteen or twenty feet and forms an almost impenetrable
                    coppice burthening the air with its fragrance

                    i went straight to my own room and commenced to work afresh on the
                    biliteral cipher more than ever had i the conviction upon me that
                    the reading of the secret writing would be the first step to the
                    attainment of my wishes regarding marjory it would have been strange
                    therefore if i had not first attempted the method which she had
                    herself suggested the reducing the baconian cipher to its lowest
                    elements for many hours i laboured at this work and finally when i
                    had reduced the baconian five symbols to three i felt that i had
                    accomplished all that was possible in that way when i had arrived
                    at this result and had tested its accuracy in working i felt in a
                    position to experiment with my new knowledge on the old number cipher
                    first i wrote out my method of reduction as a sort of addendum to
                    the paper which i had prepared for marjory then i made a key to
                    cipher and one to decipher by this time the night was well on and the
                    grey of early morning was beginning to steal in by the edges of the
                    blinds i was not sleepy however i was too much excited to think of
                    sleep for the solving of the problem seemed almost within my grasp
                    excited to a state which almost frightened me by its intensity i got
                    ready my copy of the number cipher and my newly prepared key with an
                    effort which took me all my resolution i went on steadily writing
                    its proper letter under each combination without once looking back
                    for i knew that even should some of the letters be misplaced in the
                    key the chance of recognising the right ones would be largely
                    increased by seeing a considerable number of letters together then
                    i glanced over the whole and found that many of the symbols made up
                    letters with such a basis to work on the rest was only labour a few
                    tentative efforts and i had corrected the key to agreement with some
                    of the combinations in the cipher
