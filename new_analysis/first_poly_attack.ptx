            <title>Falconer's Attack on Polyalphabetics</title>

            <xi:include href="../quote_code/falconer_poly.ptx" />

            <p>
                So begins John Falconer's discussion of using the polyalphabetic cipher.  As with other cryptographers 
                of his time he agrees that the cipher, while secure, is to slow an cumbersome and so not worth the 
                trouble of using.  However, for the sake of giving a complete account of the current state of the 
                science of cryptography in his time, Falconer goes on to discuss in detail 
                how to encipher and decipher messages with this type of cipher.  What is interesting and more 
                significant is that he makes a solid attempt at cracking this cipher, possibly the first real attack since 
                its invention<xref ref="cr_crypt_kahn" detail="p.155"/>.
            </p>
            <p>
                For his first example of how to attack a polyalphabetic cipher Falconer assumes each line is enciphered by a separate 
                cipher alphabet. <xref ref="cr_crypt_falconer" detail="pp.20-23 (48-51)" />

                    <li>
                        Looking at Falconer's cipher text, why would you assume that the <em>Y</em> represented <em>i</em>? 
                        What other letter might it represent?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How did He decide that line 15, which starts with <em>P</em>, was the one that was used to encipher 
                        the first line of the cipher text?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Verify that the fifteenth line is the correct one to use for the first line by deciphering the rest of the 
                        line.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Looking at the next three lines of the cipher text try, without looking at the accompanying plain text, 
                        to decide which row of the <em>counter-table</em> was used to encipher them.  What can you look at to try 
                        and help you decide?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finally, what is the keyword of phrase that was used to encipher this message?
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the next section of his text Falconer tackles the problem of deciphering a message in which we switch alphabet with each 
                new word.  It is here that he makes a significant observation that can help us find the length of the keyword.
            </p>

            <xi:include href="../quote_code/falconer_poly3.ptx"/>

            <p>
                Let's try to see if we can make sense of Falconer's advice and decipher the message below.
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Start by trying to find some repeated pieces of text. Falconer seems to imply that these are 
                        enciphered using the same alphabet from his counter-table; thinking about how we use the 
                        Vigen&#x00E8;re cipher normally why could we end up getting theses repetitions? 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How far apart are the repeated strings?  What factors do they have in common?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Follow Falconer's advice and break the message into groups of strings which 
                        were enciphered (hopefully) with the same shift.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now use what we learned about frequency analysis to figure out the words in each group.  Keep 
                        in mind that each shift corresponds to a row in Falconer's counter-table and that the row markers 
                        should spell out a keyword.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What does our message say? What was the keyword?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How did finding the length of the keyword help reduce this problem to one we had already solved?
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <p>
                Exactly one hundred years after Vigen&#x00E8;re published his work Falconer lead us in the right direction to 
                crack the  polyalphabetic substitution cipher. First, he pointed out that whether we encipher 
                each new line, word, or letter by a different alphabet if we can group elements of the message which were 
                enciphered the same way together then we can treat each group as a monoalphabetic substitution cipher.  
                Additionally, if we can identify the length of the key then we can use that to figure out how to group 
                the strings or characters together.  However, Falconer was still very much tied down to the use of word 
                spacings, without them his descriptions and attacks would not work.  It would be another century and a 
                half before Charles Babbage
                <idx>Babbage, Charles</idx>
                 and Friedrich Kasiski 
                <idx>Kasiski, Friedrich</idx>
                 would recognize how to expand these ideas into a general plan of attack.
