            <title>The Power of Prime Factors</title>
            <p>
                The strength of Falconer's keyed columnar  transposition cipher is the almost astronomical 
                number of combinations of keys that can be used.  As we have seen previously with just three 
                characters we have six row keys which, depending on how many of them we use and how we arrange 
                them, can give us one thousand nine hundred fifty six subtly different ciphers.  If we 
                increase the number of characters to four or five then that number goes up to

                respectively.  This would seem to offer security in the extreme, but as we will see, Falconer himself 
                gives us two relatively simple ways to crack this cipher.  We begin with the more mathematical approach.

                    <li>
                        In the second column of the second table there is a 6 under the 3, how did Falconer 
                        come up with that?

                        In the last paragraph Falconer tells us that if 450 were the number of blocks 
                        of text in the enciphered message then one of the factors of 450 
                        is the number of key letters in the message.  Looking back at how Falconer's 
                        transposition cipher works why is this the case?

            <title>But Really There's an Easier Way (sort of)</title>
            <p>
                After walking us through a careful exposition of how to find all the factors of a number and 
                encouraging us to use this in order to find out the number of letters used for our key, Falconer 
                lets us know that there is effectively an easier way to attack his own cipher.

                A few closing observations:

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Look carefully at how the blocks of characters (columns in the tables) are grouped after they are deciphered, 
                        i.e. did you ever get column one next to column thirteen or fourteen?  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Why do you think this happened? How might it be related to the number of key letters?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Given your answers to the previous questions, how can we make use of Falconer's strategies for 
                        finding divisors and the number of key letters?
                    </li>
                </ul>
