            <p>
                The strength of Falconer's keyed columnar  transposition cipher is the almost astronomical 
                number of combinations of keys that can be used.  As we have seen previously with just three 
                characters we have six row keys which, depending on how many of them we use and how we arrange 
                them, can give us one thousand nine hundred fifty six subtly different ciphers.  If we 
                increase the number of characters to four or five then that number goes up to

                respectively.  This would seem to offer security in the extreme, but as we will see, Falconer himself 
                gives us two relatively simple ways to crack this cipher.  We begin with the more mathematical approach.

                        Falconer tells us to multiply each prime in the second table by all the figures to its left, why don't we get duplicate numbers then?  What rule did he not explicitly state?

                        In the last paragraph Falconer tells us that if 450 were the number of blocks of text in the enciphered message then one of the factors of 450 is the number of key letters in the message.  Looking back at how Falconer's transposition cipher works why is this the case?

                        First make a table of the primes factors by writing down the 210 and under that a 2 (since it is even), then next to the 210 write 105=210/2.  Next, with a little work, we see that 105 is divisible by 3, so write 3 under the 105 and 35 next to 105, since 35=105/3.  Continue this process to fill in <xref ref="primes_first_checkpoint"/> with the rest of the prime factors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now make a table with the prime factors written across the top.  Starting with the second column, multiply each number in the table by all the numbers to its left by which it has not already been multiplied.  So, we multiply 3 by 2 to get 6, then 5 by 2 to get 10 and so on.  Try to finish filling in <xref ref="factors_first_checkpoint"/>.

                        There are thirty blocks of text.  Factoring that, we get the prime factors 2,3, and 5.  Putting these together, the complete list of factors of 30 is 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30.  Since Falconer's cipher requires writing letters into a table, we can conclude that the table's dimensions were likely 3 by 10, 5 by 6, 6 by 5, or 10 by 3. (It is unlikely that the table was 1 by 30 or 2 by 15.)  Using this information we can conclude that there were likely 3, 5, or 6 key letters and we could try to pick apart the message.

            <title>But Really There's an Easier Way (sort of)</title>
            <p>
                After walking us through a careful exposition of how to find all the factors of a number and 
                encouraging us to use this in order to find out the number of letters used for our key, Falconer 
                lets us know that there is effectively an easier way to attack his own cipher.

                    <li>
                        There is a <em>Q</em> in row one column six, what needs to come after that?  What column is it in?

                    <li>
                        In line three are there three letters you could put together to get a common English ending? 
                        Are there other letters you could arrange with them in order to get an entire word?

                    <li>
                        Finally, columns thirteen and fourteen only have two characters in them each, where do you think 
                        they belong if we were to rearrange the lines?

                        <q>If winter comes, can spring be far behind</q>  By Percy Bysshe Shelly

                </answer>
                <solution>
                    <p>
                        Begin by writing each block of text vertically and looking for scrambled words.  From the hint we know to look for the word WINTER.  Spotting the letters to spell WINTER in the top row we rearrange the columns and then start to look for other words.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15

                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        You should notice that columns 3 and 4 can spell IF in the first row and if we put them at the beginning we also get the word SPRING in the second row.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        2 1 5 8 10 6 3 4 7 9 11 12 13 14 15

                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        Reassuringly we see that this also gives us the name PERCY in the third row and SHELLY wrapping around from row 3 to 4.  Finally, you may notice that swapping columns 9 and 7, and columns 12 and 13 will give us the word COMES in the first row.
                    </p>

                        After make those last two swaps we can now read off an entire message.

                        Look carefully at how the blocks of characters (columns in the tables) are grouped after they are deciphered, i.e. did you ever get column one next to column thirteen or fourteen?

                    <li>
                        Why do you think this happened? How might it be related to the number of key letters?
