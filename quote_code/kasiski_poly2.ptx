                        76. ... where repetitions of two or more ciphers are found in the cipher text one can conclude 
                        that these are due to the fact that, in enciphering, repetitions in the plain text were 
                        repeatedly combined with the same letters or the key.

                        If we encipher with the key <q><c>BERLIN</c></q> as above, we shall frequently find in the 
                        cipher text in columns 1 and 2 the ciphers <c>UL</c>, in 2 and 3 <c>XY</c>, in 3 and 4 <c>KS</c>, 
                        in 4 and 5 <c>EP</c>, and in 5 and 6 <c>BU</c> because these ciphers 
                        <c>UL, XY, KS, EP</c> and <c>BU</c> have arisen by combining 
                        the letters <c>BE, ER, RL, LI</c> and <c>IN</c> in the key with the 
                        [repetitions of] <c>th</c> in the text. <xref ref="cr_crypt_kasiski" detail="pp.30-31 (35-36)" />
