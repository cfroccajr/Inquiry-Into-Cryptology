                        A. General Remarks.

                        72. The actual art of deciphering consists in deciphering any unknown cipher text without 
                        previous knowledge of the meaning of the ciphers and without the key.
                    </p>
                    <p>  ... </p>
                    <p>
                        It is impossible to discover the key from a few words of cipher text ... . Consequently we must 
                        have available at least four to six rows of cipher text if we are to be able to recover the key.
                    </p>
                    <p> ... </p>
                    <p>
                        75. The influence of the key finds expression in the fact that at intervals of as many 
                        ciphers as the key contains letters repetition of single ciphers or of several ciphers can occur, 
                        which can only be due to the fact that, when the same letters of the key were united with a 
                        repetition of the plain text to form ciphers. If we have a relatively long cipher text which 
                        is enciphered with the key <q><c>Berlin</c>,</q> and if we divide it off into rows of six ciphers and number 
                        the ciphers of each row from one to six, we shall find that among the ciphers numbered 1 of each 
                        row the cipher <c>U</c> occurs most frequently, among the ciphers numbered 2 <c>I</c> is most frequent, the most 
                        frequent among the ciphers numbered 3 is <c>V</c>, among the ciphers numbered 4 <c>Y</c>, among the ciphers 
                        numbered 5 <c>B</c>, and among the ciphers numbered 6 <c>F</c>. 
                        This is because the ciphers <c>U, I, V, Y, B</c> and <c>F</c> have 
                        [likely] arisen by combination of the letters
                        <c>b, e, r, l, i, n</c> of the key with the letter <c>e</c> of the text; 
                        since according to [previous observations] the letter e occurs most frequently in the text, 
                        naturally the above ciphers must occur most frequently under the numbers mentioned.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next most frequent in this cipher text are the ciphers <c>S</c> in column one, <c>E</c> in column two, 
                        <c>K</c> in column three, <c>P</c> in column four, <c>W</c> in column 
                        five and <c>V</c> in column six because these 
                        ciphers <c>S, E, K, P, W</c> and <c>V</c> result from a combination of the letters <c>b, e, r, l, i, n</c> of the 
                        key with the letter <c>t</c> of the text and t is the next most common letter letter after e.
