        <title><em>First, Distinguish the Vowels from the Consonants.</em></title>

                    And first, the vowels generally discover themselves by their frequency; for because they are but few in number, and no word made up without some of them, they must frequently be used in any writing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Where you find any character or letter standing by it self, it must be a vowel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you find any character doubled in the beginning of a word, in any language it is a vowel, as <em>Aaron, Eel, Jilt, Oogala, Vulture, etc.</em>, except for some English proper names, as Llandaff or Lloyd.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In monosyllables of two letters you may distinguish it from the consonant joined with it by its frequency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a word of three letters beginning and ending in the same letter the vowel is probably included.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When you find a character doubled in the middle of a word of four letters, `tis probably the vowel <em>e</em> or <em>o</em>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In Polysyllables, where a character is double in the middle of the word, it is for the most part a consonant; and if so, the precedent letter is always a vowel, and very often the following.<xref ref="cr_crypt_falconer" detail="pp. 8-9" />
