            <ol>
                <li>
                    A word of three letters, beginning and ending with the same, may be supposed <em>did</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    A word consisting of four characters, with the same letter in the beginning and
                    end, is probably <em>that</em> or <em>hath</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    A word consisting of five letters, when the second and last are the same,
                    is commonly <em>which</em>, though it may be otherways, as in <em>known</em>,
                    <em>serve</em>, etc. And you may judge of the truth of such suppositions by the
                    frequency of the letters in the word supposed.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Next you may compare words one with another, as <em>on</em> and <em>no</em>, each being
            the other reversed; so <em>of</em> and <em>for</em>, the last being the first reversed
            with the addition of a letter; for and from will discover each other, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may also likewise observe some of the usual propositions and terminations of 
            words, such as <em>com, con, ing, ed</em>, etc. Note that <em>t</em> and <em>h</em> 
            are often joined in the beginning and end of English words, and sometimes in the 
            middle.<xref ref="cr_crypt_falconer" detail="pp. 11-12" />
