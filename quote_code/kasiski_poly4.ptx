                        85. ... If we have determined according to section 80, the number of letters
                        in the key, we divide the cipher text into rows containing as many ciphers
                        as the key contains letters and number the several columns. In theory those 
                        ciphers which occur most frequently in a given column should signify the 
                        letter e in the text;
                    </p>
                    <p> ... </p>
                    <p>
                        86. After we have divided the cipher text into rows according to the number
                        of letters in the key and have numbered the several columns, we take out all 
                        ciphers from column 1 and note the number oÂ£ occurrences, then we do the same 
                        for columns, 2, 3, etc. [See <xref ref="example_kasiski" text="type-global"/>]

                        If we have found in this way the cipher <c>U</c>, let us say, occurs seven times, cipher 
                        <c>S</c> three times and cipher <c>F</c> three times in column 1, we copy from the key table 
                        letters beneath the ciphers <c>U, S</c> and <c>F</c> on a separate sheet of paper as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <cd>
                            <cline>7 U - Q B U G M H C D N J</cline>
                            <cline>3 S - O Z S E K F A B L H</cline>
                            <cline>3 F - B M F R X S N O Y U</cline>
                        </cd>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Among these letters must be found the first letter of the key.  The letter <c>B</c> occurs as 
                        second letter under cipher <c>U</c>, as eighth under cipher <c>S</c>, and as first under cipher 
                        <c>F</c>.  Hence <c>B</c> is combined seven times with <em>t</em> to form <c>U</c>, three times 
                        with <em>r</em> to form <c>S</c>, and three times with <em>e</em> to form <c>F</c>. From this we 
                        must conclude that <c>B</c> is the first letter of the key.  The letter <c>M</c> also has a 
                        more remote probability of being the first letter of the key since it occurs as fifth under 
                        <c>U</c>, and as second under <c>F</c> ... . In the same way we just found the first letter 
                        of the key, we now look for the other letters. <xref ref="cr_crypt_kasiski" detail="pp.34-35 (39-40)" />
