                        1. Having found an alphabet for the first, second, or indeed any word near the beginning of the epistle, go through 
                        all the immediate following words, until you find another that is decyphered by the same alphabet.
                    </q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>
                        2. From the last found word count the like number, and you have a new word decypherable by the found-alphabet: and thus 
                        you may go on until you have once gone through the whole writing, marking the whole series with some particular mark: 
                        And then,
                    </q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>
                        3. Begin the epistle again at some word immediately before or after that which was first found, and count forwards 
                        as before, until you come to the end of the epistle. 
                        [Repeat this process until each word is marked as part of a series.]
