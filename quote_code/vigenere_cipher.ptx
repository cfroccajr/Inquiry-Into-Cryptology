                ... set the capitals which run across the top [of the table] for the message to be conveyed &amp; and those that run perpendicularly down the left for the keys.  I have put two rows of capitals here, one black and the other red, to show that alphabets of the text as, the keys, may be transposed and changed in as many ways as you want to keep knowledge of them from all others except ones correspondents. Therefore, to encipher the saying we used previously <em><q>au nom de l'eternel,</q></em> with the key <em><q>le jour obscur</q></em> proceed in this way; from <em>a</em> in the alphabet across the top in red, come to the row with <em>l</em> and the box with <em>b</em>: u from e will be q: n from i, n: o from o, s: m from u, a: d from r, m: e from o, i: l from b, c: e from s, o: t from c, n: e from u, q: r from r, c: n from l, o: e from e, a: l from i, l. Altogether we egt <em>bqnsamiconcoal</em> &amp; so on for the remainder.
