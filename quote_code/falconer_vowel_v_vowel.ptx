                    Compare their frequency, and <em>e</em>, as we observed before, is generally the most used in
                    the English tongue, next <em>o</em>, then <em>a</em> and <em>i</em>; but <em>u</em> and <em>y</em>
                    are not so frequently used as some of the consonants.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is remarkable that amongst the vowels, <em>e</em> and <em>o</em> are often doubled, the rest seldom
                    or never.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>e</em> is very often a terminal letter, and <em>y</em> terminates words, but they are
                    distinguishable, because there is no proportion to their frequency: <em>o</em> is not often
                    in the end of words, except in monosyllables.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>e</em> is the only vowel that can be doubled in the end of an English word, except
                    <em>o</em> in <em>too</em>, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You may consider which of the vowels, in any language, can stand alone, as <em>a</em>, <em>i</em>,
                    and sometimes <em>o</em> in English, <em>a</em>, <em>e</em>, <em>o</em>, in Latin or <em>i</em>
                    the imperative of <em>eo</em>.<xref ref="cr_crypt_falconer" detail="pp. 9-10" />
