                    <q>1. Search in the several lines for some of the particles [(words or n-grams)] of that language you shall suppose 
                    the epistle to have been writ in. If in English, make suppositions, e.g. for such little words as 
                    <em>the, that, for, of, to, and, etc.</em> and the like, without some of which no man can well express 
                    business of any moment.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>2. Having supposed in any of the lines; for some one of those mentioned, or the like particles, 
                    you may prove the truth of your supposition, by taking out the opposite letters of all the lines: 
                    And if they do not make words, or syllables, or produce such letters as can probably follow one 
                    another in that order, your first supposition is false, and you must suppose anew.</q> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>3. Having by fresh suppositions found some useful word: And the letters of the other lines 
                    (in the same order) agreeing, the words or syllables arising from them, will direct you to 
                    some new [column] that goes before or after in the true order: And thus you may proceed till you 
                    have found out the whole writing, which by this time will be no great difficulty.</q>
