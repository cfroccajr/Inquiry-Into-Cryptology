            <em>Schottus</em> demonstrates, (though the calculation in his book be not exact) that a thousand million of men in as many years could not write down all those different transpositions of the alphabet, granting every one should complete forty pages a day, and every page contain forty several positions: For if one writer in one day write forty pages, everyone containing forty combinations, 40 multiplied by 40, gives 1,600, the number he completes in one day, which multiplied by 366, the number (and more) of days in a year; a writer in one year shall compass 585,600 distinct rows.  Therefore in a thousand million of years he could write <me>585,600,000,000,000,</me> which being multiplied by 1,000,000,000, the number of writers supposed, the product will be <me>585,600,000,000,000,000,000,000,</me> which wants of the number of combinations no less than <me>348,484,017,332,394,393,600,000.</me>
