                Say for example we mutually establish <em>k</em> as the index of the mobile circle.  
                Writing, the formulae are positioned at will, say such <em>k</em> lies under the 
                uppercase <em>B</em> [<xref ref="figure_alberti_disk" text="type-global"/>]
                and the next letter corresponds to the letter that comes next.  
                In writing to you, I will first put the uppercase <em>B</em> under which lies the 
                index <em>k</em> in the formula; this is to signal you far away, wanting to read what 
                I have written, that you should set up the twin formula in your keeping, positioning 
                the mobile circle so that the <em>B</em> sits over the index <em>k</em>.  Then all of 
                the rest of the lowercase letters present in the coded text will take their meaning 
                and sound from those of the fixed circle above them.

                After I have written three or four words I will mutate the position of the index in our 
                formula, rotating the disk let's say, so that the index <em>k</em> falls below the 
                upper case <em>R</em>.  Then in this missive I write an uppercase <em>R</em> to indicate 
                that <em>k</em> no longer refers to <em>B</em>, but to <em>R</em>, and the letters that 
                will follow will assume new meanings.
