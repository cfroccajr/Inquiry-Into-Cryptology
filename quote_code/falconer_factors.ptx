                            figures in the table towards the left hand, setting the several products in the third

                            Now 450, the number given, being divided by 2, a prime divisor, the quotient is 225, 
                            which being divided by 3, you have 75 for a new quotient; and again divided by 3, you 
                            have 25 for another quotient. This last divided by 5, gives 5, which being a prime 
                            number, you have 1, or unity in the last quotient of all: so that your prime divisors 
                            are, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, all which set down in the tops of the columns [of a new table], 
                            and multiplying them according to the [second] rule given, the operation will stand thus.
