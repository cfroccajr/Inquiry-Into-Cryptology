            "<alert>5. On the replacement of letters using the decimally-weighted numerical alphabet:</alert>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    By substituting decimal numerical alphabet for letters in four different ways:
                    by writing the numbers in words as pronounced; or by finger-bending, using the fingers to communicate the message visually to a recipient; or by writing the numbers as numerals such as writing <em>(mhmd: forty, eight, forty, four)</em>; or by giving the cryptogram a semblance of a page of a financial register.
                </li>
                <li>
                    By recovering the cryptogram numeral into a number of letters - a method of encipherment which involves more sophistication. There are many combinations that can be used in this method; for example in <em>(mhmd: jl, fb, jl, ca)</em> or <em>(kk, ga, kk, bb)</em> . One can even form delusive words such as <em>(mhmd: lead, cad, deal, baa)</em>, or substitute two words for a letter,
                    e.g. <em>(ali: <m>\overline{dig\ fad}</m>, <m>\overline{cab\ ab}</m>)</em>,
                    in which case a line is to be drawn over two words to denote that they represent one letter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    By multiplying the number representing the letter by two, and so write <em>(mhmd: q, jf, q, h)</em> and <em>(ali: ob, jh)</em>, etc; or multiply it by three, thus writing <em>(mhmd: sk, kd, sk, jb)</em> and <em>(ali: rc, kg)</em>. Numbers can also be multiplied by four or five."

                        The examples here are very loosely based on the Arabic examples in the translation. The "mhmd" is Mohamed since Arabic is written without vowels, and for "ali" the a and l together are treated as a single letter.
