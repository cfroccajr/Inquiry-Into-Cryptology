                    <pre>
                        I am forced to keep the Soldiers
                        upon hard duty and hard diet:
                        Supply us, or they will revolt to
                        the enemy speedily. Hast.

                        1. When there is only one alphabet used for a line, the writing might be discovered an in 
                        plain cipher, if you make a new operation for each line.  But there may be other ways to 
                        decypher any such writing: for,
                    </q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>
                        2. If you find out but one letter in a line, (and that may certainly be done by a few suppositions) 
                        it will of itself give an alphabet for the whole line, as you may perceive by the 
                        <em>counter-table</em>, which follows: ... you need only to search for <em>i</em> in the upper line of it, 
                        and try in what line <em>Y</em> is opposite to it; and those two lines give you an alphabet.
                    </q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>
                        Having found one alphabet for the first line, you have likewise by this means the first letter of the key. e.g. 
                        In the fifteenth line of the table, <em>Y</em> standing against <em>i</em>, and <em>P</em> beginning 
                        that line (as you may perceive) <em>P</em> must be the first letter of the key;
                    </q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>
                        ... you may proceed to find the alphabet of the second, third, or any other line, as you did the first;
                    </q>
                </p>
