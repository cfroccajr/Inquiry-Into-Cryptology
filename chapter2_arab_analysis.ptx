            The first place math was employed in the science of cryptology was in the analysis of languages.  The following is from <em>al-Kindi's</em><idx>al-Kindi</idx> treatise on cryptanalysis written around the year 873 CE.  Try to read through it carefully and then consider the questions that follow it.

                        <q>In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the
                        University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course
                        prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,
                        I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant
                        Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before
                        I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at
                        Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and
                        was already deep in the enemyâ€™s country. I followed, however, with many
                        other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded
                        in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once
                        entered upon my new duties.</q> - <em>A Study in Scarlet</em>, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle <xref ref="cr_doyle_sis" />

        <title> Falconer's Approach</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>
                In 1685 John Falconer<idx>Falconer, John</idx>, who we met briefly in <xref ref="section_ancient_ciphers"/>, wrote the second ever published text in English on the subject of cryptology; it has the rather lengthy title <em>Cryptomenysis patefacta; or, the art of secret information disclosed without a key. containing plain and demonstrative rule, for decyphering</em>.  Beyond this work little is known about him for certain. A descendant of his writing in the nineteenth century claimed that John was the personal cipher keeper for King James II and followed the king into exile in France where he died.  In slim support of this the book is dedicated to the king and addresses it to King James II's secretary of state.  However, no readily available documented evidence exists to independently corroborate his descendant's claims, and in fact there are some tax records for John and his wife, Mary Dalmahoy, in Edinburgh Scotland, from 1695, over six years after James fled to France. <xref ref="cr_crypt_rocca_falconer"/>
            </p>
            <p>
                In his text John Falconer presents a wide variety of ciphers and for most of them suggestions for how we might attack them.  In this section we will focus on his suggestions for how we may attack what we now call monoalphabetic substitution ciphers.

                        Falconer's first three pieces of advice are similar to what we have looked at before;
                        his fourth comment is something a little new.  Using the same text which you analyzed before
                        set the <em>n-gram counter</em> to count two letter combinations in your text (<m>N=2</m>). Once you have
                        the count take note of which combinations of letters appear most often and for each vowel which two or
                        three consonants it is most often paired with.

                    When you are done you should have generated for yourself a guide which you can use when you are 
                    attempting to analyze a piece of cipher text.  To begin find a new piece of relatively typical 
                    English text which is at least 1000 characters long.  You will use the <em>sage cells</em> to 
                    examine this text in the following exercises.

                        decyphering in one language, you may decipher an epistle in any, even tho the plain speech 
                        itself be a mystery to you, if you first observe the frequency of the letters, the terminal 
                        letters, what letters can be doubled in the beginning, middle, and end of words; and such

                    Find a large piece of typical text written in a language other than English.  Perform an

                    Finally, encipher a message written in this new language which 
                    your classmates can try to decipher using your cheat sheet.

                    A lot of the general advice that Falconer gave us was good, but his specifics didn't match 
                    what we expect to see when we read a more modern text.  Find a typical piece of text or 
                    literature from seventeenth century England (or better yet Scotland) and analyze this text 
                    to create a cheat sheet like the one you did for modern English.  How do your findings match 
                    what Falconer told us to expect?
