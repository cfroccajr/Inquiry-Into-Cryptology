                The cipher we will focus on here, Hill's Cipher, is an early example of a cipher based purely in the mathematics of 
                number theory and algebra; the areas of mathematics which now dominate all of modern 
                cryptography.  Number theory has a long and rich history with many fundamental results dating all the way back to Euclid in 300 BCE, and with results found across the globe in different cultures.  Number theory as we understand and use it today is due in large part to Carl Friedrich Gauss and his text 
                <em>Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</em> published in 1801 (when Gauss was 24).  Algebra (or more properly linear and abstract algebra) as it is going to be used here is much younger tracing its roots back only a couple hundred years to the early nineteenth century; here too much is owed to Gauss.

                As with previous topics we will begin by looking at an original source text and trying to understand what it is saying.  However, given the importance of this material to the rest of what we will be discussing in subsequent chapters, we will look at the material from a more modern perspective.

                Reading Questions:

                    <li>
                        Hill starts by describing how we will add and multiply with the alphabet, looking at his 
                        description why in his illustration does <m>j+w</m> which should be <m>25+14=39</m> 
                        (see <xref ref="hill_alpha_numeric_corespondence">Hill's Correspondence</xref>) come 
                        out to be <m>m</m> which is 13?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In his illustration he also says <m>hm</m> which should be 4 times 13, or 52, is 
                        <m>k</m> which is 0, why is this the case?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Along the same lines, why does <m>f+y</m> equal <m>k</m> and why does <m>an</m> (<m>a</m> times <m>n</m>) 
                        equal <m>z</m>?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Thinking about your previous answers, what are the values of the following: <m>j+z</m>, 
                        <m>nf</m>, <m>au+j</m>, and <m>bv+jw</m>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                In this section of text Hill has introduced us to the idea of modular arithmetic and modular equivalence, in 
                particular the idea of equivalence modulo 26.  This is a concept which will be central to most 
                everything else we do so we need to spend a little more time trying to precisely understand modular 
                equivalence.

                        If <m>n</m> is a positive integer then we say that two other integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> 
                        are <term>equivalent modulo n</term><idx>modular equivalence</idx> if and 
                        only if they have the same remainder when divided by <m>n</m>, or equivalently if and only if 
                        <m>a-b</m> is divisible by <m>n</m>, when this is the case we write 
                        <md>

                <p>
                    Suppose that <m>n=14</m>, then <m>36\equiv 8\pmod{n}</m> because <m>36=2\cdot 14 + 8</m> and 
                    <m>8=0\cdot (14) + 8</m> so we get the same remainder when we divide by <m>n=14</m>.  Alternately,
                    we can observe that <m>36-8=28</m> and <m>28=2\cdot(14)</m> is divisible by <m>n=14</m>.

                <p>
                    Using the same value for <m>n</m> we get that <m>3\cdot 5\equiv 1\pmod{n}</m> because 
                    <m>15=1\cdot (14) +1</m>, so the remainder when <m>3\cdot 5</m> is divided by <m>n</m> is 1.

                        For example the greatest common divisor of 7 and 36 is 1 so they are relatively prime, 
                        however the greatest common divisor of 30 and 36 is 6 so they are not relatively prime.

                        An <em>affine cipher</em> is a cipher with a two part key, a multiplier <m>m</m> and a shift 
                        <m>s</m> and calculations are carried out using modular arithmetic; typically the modulus is 
                        <m>n=26</m>.  Characters of the plain text are enciphered with the formula
                        <me>CIPHER\,\equiv\, m(plain)+s\pmod{26},</me>
                        and characters of the cipher text are deciphered with the formula
                        <me>plain\,\equiv\, m^{-1}(CIPHER-s)\pmod{26},</me>
                        or
                        <me>plain\,\equiv\, m^{-1}CIPHER-m^{-1}s\pmod{26}.</me>
                        Note that the multiplier <m>m</m> must be relatively prime to the modulus so that it has a 
                        multiplicative inverse.

                        Let's encipher the message <q><c>hello world</c></q> with an affine cipher and a key of 
                        <m>m=5</m> and <m>s=16</m>; assume that we match up the alphabet with the integers from 
                        0 to 25 in the usual way so that <c>a</c> is 0, <c>b</c> is 1, <c>c</c> is 2, etc..  In this 
                        way the letter <c>h</c> is replaced by the number 7 and when we encipher it we get
                        <me>5\cdot 7+16\equiv 25\pmod{26}</me> and 25 is <c>Z</c>, so plain <c>h</c> becomes 
                        cipher <c>Z</c>.  Next <c>e</c> is replaced by 4 and we get
                        <me>5\cdot 4+16\equiv 10\pmod{26}</me> and 10 is <c>K</c>, so plain <c>e</c> becomes 
                        cipher <c>K</c>.  The plain <c>l</c> corresponds to 11 and 
                        <me>5\cdot 11+16\equiv 19\pmod{26}</me>, which is <c>T</c>, that is plain <c>l</c> is 
                        replaced by cipher <c>T</c>.  Try to encipher the rest of the message on your own,

                        <m>m^{-1}\equiv 19\pmod{26}</m> and <m>-s\equiv 22\pmod{26}</m>. Take the <c>A</c> and 
                        replace it by 0 and then using the formula above we get
                        <me>19(0+22)\equiv 2\pmod{26}</me> so we replace cipher <c>A</c> with plain text <c>c</c>.  
                        The <c>J</c> is replaced by 9 and 
                        <me>19(9+22)\equiv 17\pmod{26}</me> therefore cipher <c>J</c> becomes plain <c>r</c>.  
                        To use the other formula for deciphering we need <m>m^{-1}s\equiv 2\pmod{26}</m>.  Then 
                        converting the cipher <c>I</c> to 8 we get 
                        <me>19(8)+2\equiv 24\pmod{26}</me> which is plain <c>y</c> or with the next letter <c>N</c> 
                        we get <me>19(13)+2\equiv 15\pmod{26}</me> which is <c>p</c>.  Try to decipher the remaining 
                        characters in the message on your own.

            <p>
                To <em>decrypt</em>, as opposed to just decipher, an affine cipher you can use the techniques we learned in 
                <xref ref="chapter_basic_analysis" text="type-global"/> since they are a type of 
                monoalphabetic substitution cipher.  However, we can also take advantage of the fact that it is an 
                affine cipher.

            <p>
                Analyzing this we get that the most common characters are <c>Y</c>, <c>D</c>, <c>I</c>, <c>O</c> 
                and <c>U</c>; the most common bigrams are <c>DZ</c>, <c>ZY</c>, <c>YG</c>, and <c>OB</c>; the 
                most common trigrams are <c>DZY</c>, <c>OBO</c>, <c>LDZ</c>, and <c>DZO</c>.  Therefore it is 
                reasonable to assume that <c>DZY</c> is <c>the</c>, <c>Y</c>  is <c>e</c>, and <c>D</c> 
                is <c>t</c>.  So when this was enciphered we have to of had 
                <md>
                    <mrow>24\equiv m\cdot 4+s \pmod{26}</mrow>
                    <mrow>3 \equiv m\cdot 19+s \pmod{26}</mrow>
                </md>
                Subtracting the second expression from the first we get
                <md>
                    <mrow>21\equiv m\cdot -15 \pmod{26}</mrow>
                </md>
                or
                <md>
                    <mrow>21\equiv m\cdot 11 \pmod{26}.</mrow>
                </md>
                Looking at the multiplication table modulo 26 we can see that <m>m=9</m> since 
                <m>9\cdot 11\equiv 21\pmod{26}</m>.  Substituting <m>m=9</m> into the first equation above 
                we get 
                <md>
                    <mrow>24\equiv 9\cdot 4+s \pmod{26}</mrow>
                </md>
                which simplifies to
                <md>
                    <mrow>24-10\equiv s \pmod{26}</mrow>
                </md>
                so that <m>s=14</m>.  We can then get the inverse keys <m>m^{-1}\equiv 3\pmod{26}</m> and 
                <m>-m^{-1}s\equiv 10\pmod{26}</m>.  Using these with the affine cipher cell we get the 
                deciphered message:
