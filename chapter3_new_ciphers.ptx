        <p>
            In this chapter look at real improvements to cryptology:
            <ul>
                <li> Polyalphabetics (Alberti)</li>
                <li> Autokey Cipher (Vigen&#x00E8;re)</li>
                <li> Keyed Columnar Ciphers and Codes (Falconer)</li>
                <li> Thomas Jefferson's contributions???</li>
            </ul>
